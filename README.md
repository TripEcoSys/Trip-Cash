# The Token

Blockchain as distributed ledger, opened the gates of opportunities for real-time online payment solutions. Adoption of this technology in travel industry has always been on the digital currency side giving us just another way of payment for our reservations. Although this is avery important feature as the payments no longer would need extra fees there is an unseen cost-machine at the back of the transactions thus explaining the higher prices. We believe that blockchain technology and digital currencies will eventually solve the transaction fee problem.To take it a step further, we will redefine how the travel product is defined and consumed while providing a real-time solution for BSP. Let’s take a further look.

## Further Solution (TripPay)
TripPay(TCH) is a ERC20 compatible token based on Ethereum. Blockchain, in its nature, offers a basic and fundamental solution. It is the immutable history of the transactions and thus expressing the final ownership of the assets. Assets can be money, a license or a ticket. Its elegant design in keeping a secure, distributed chain of information would help real business scenarios as discussed in the former section. The key points further is aiming to achieve are.
Real-time settlement :

* Decentralizing the process of settlement, thus removing the mediator.
* Reducing the amount of money kept or blocked in deposit or safety accounts.
* Cost reduction on payments.
*	Simultaneous cross-border payments.
*	Customizable travel asset.
*	Interoperability like merger, divide, exchange of the travel assets.


_The digital coins used by TripEcoSys are not registered by any government, its function is subject to the trust of its users, everything flows according to supply and demand. The cryptocurrency that we will use will be the TripPay(TCH) token._
